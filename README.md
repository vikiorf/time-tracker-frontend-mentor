## My process

### Built with

- Semi-Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How I can use background-image along with background-position to my advantage.
Below is a demonstration where I set the background image seperately and position the image in the shown class.

```css
.activity-image {
  background-origin: border-box;
  background-position: top -10px right 10px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  position: absolute;
  height: 65px;
  opacity: 0.9;
  width: 100px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still very new to web development, but I think as far as a first project goes, this was great.
I should get better at semantic markup.
